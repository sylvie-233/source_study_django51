Django 5.0.4 release notes
==========================

*Expected April 2, 2024*

Django 5.0.4 fixes several bugs in 5.0.3.

Bugfixes
========

* Fixed a bug in Django 5.0 that caused a crash of ``Model.full_clean()`` on
  fields with expressions in ``db_default``. As a consequence,
  ``Model.full_clean()`` no longer validates for empty values in fields with
  ``db_default`` (:ticket:`35223`).
